# Vaultwarden role
This role creates the following:
1. vaultwarden user and group on the host OS
2. vaultwarden directories to store data
3. a vaultwarden container mounting data from the host

## configuration
This role expects three configuration parameters:
1. fileserver_htpasswd_user: user for basic auth to be stored in htpasswd file
2. filserver_htpasswd_password: password for basic auth to be stored in htpasswd file 
3. fileserver_domain: DNS domain from which the file server will serve content
4. vaultwarden_admin_user: a user to run backup procedures with permissions outside of just /opt/vaultwarden/data

##Â Additional steps
Currently, remote backups require a .ssh/config file and an ssh key under the ansible user
to allow the primary host to ssh/rsync to the secondary.
